# travis-tinkering

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannystaple/travis-tinkering.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dannystaple/travis-tinkering)

A repository to test and demonstrate compiling with travis and vagrant.

The intent is to get cross compiling environments - both CI and Desktop - a demonstration of this, so I can reproduce this for projects that are tricky to build.
